# ds01-hub

The one-stop support hub for the Hertie Data Science Lab server (ds01).

---

**This is v1.0** — we're just getting started! We welcome all feedback, ideas, and constructive criticism, big or small. If something's confusing, missing, or could be better, let us know.

---

## What you can do here
1) click `docs` dir to view latest user-facing docs (NB: all the information in these docs is also provided at-point-of-use within ds01's CLI ecosystem; just type `help` to get started, or add `--guided` flat to a command for a guided in-terminal walthrough).
2) click the `issues` tab to raise an issue to DSL (see below).

### How to raise an issue
Click **"New Issue"** to:

- **Report a bug** — something's broken, erroring, or not working as expected
- **Ask a question** — you're stuck and need guidance
- **Request access** — need resources (GPU time, MIGs), group access, or software installed
- **Book a consultation** — want hands-on help, office hours, or technical support
- **Share feedback** — have ideas to improve ds01? We want to hear them
- **Request documentation** — need a guide for something not yet documented
- **Report a status issue** — think the server might be down?

## How to file a good issue

1. **Click "New Issue"** and choose the appropriate template
2. **Fill in required fields** — especially your Hertie email so we can follow up
3. **Paste terminal output** — use code blocks:

   ````
   ```
   paste your error message or terminal output here
   ```
   ````

   This makes it much easier to read, search, and debug.

4. **Be specific** — what were you trying to do? What command did you run? What happened?
