## Raising an issue ticket
### Click "New Issue" to:

- **Report a bug** — something's broken, erroring, or not working as expected
- **Request access** — need resources (GPU time, MIGs), group access, or software installed (specify your access end date)
- **Request documentation** — lack of clarity in existing docs / need a guide for something not yet documented
- **Report a status issue** — think the server might be down (also email h.baker@hertie-school.org)
- **Request new functionality / share feedback** — have ideas to improve ds01? We want to hear them (categorize as feature request, improvement, workflow, etc.)
- **Ask a question** — you're stuck and need guidance
- **Book a consultation** — want hands-on help, office hours, or technical support


### How to file a good issue

1. **Click "New Issue"** and choose the appropriate template
2. **Fill in required fields** — especially your Hertie email so we can follow up
3. **Paste terminal output** — use code blocks:

   ````
   ```
   paste your error message or terminal output here
   ```
   ````

   This makes it easier to read, search, and debug.

4. **Be specific** — what were you trying to do? What command did you run? What happened?
